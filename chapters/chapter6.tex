\chapter{Discussion \& Future Work}
In this thesis we discussed a new approach to 3D face registration with Gaussian Process Regression and incorporating line features. We constructed a registration pipeline that uses the samples from corresponding line features on template and targets as additional prior information to define the sought deformation fields. We assumed an equidistant parametrization to be the best approach to gain approximately corresponding points on the line features of template and respective target. In order to be able to sample equidistant
points from the line features, we had to first compute an equidistant parametrization of the b\'{e}zier curves that define them. The samples then projected on to the target mesh along the visual line from the focal point of the camera model through the sample of the 2D line feature on the viewing plane. 
The Gaussian Process Posterior distribution conditioned on the residuals of the corresponding sample points in template and target mesh as well as residuals of the  corresponding landmarks. Using the Mean Squared Error as the loss function in the optimization procedure produced results with heavy artifacts, so we tried to minimize the effect of outlier regions using robust estimators.
As demonstrated in chapter \ref{chap:results} the quality of the registration was significantly enhanced through the use of line features. The registration pipeline yields deformed templates that provide a good matching of the feature regions with those of the respective targets. This is largely due to the attempted mapping of feature regions between template and target using the line features. For
transforming the 2D line features we were obliged to use an approximative approach where the different appearances of the holes in the respective scans carry the risk of influencing the results. We thereby assumed that the line features define exact correspondence by being marked in the same manner on every feature contour. Our method is not robust to line features that are slightly shifted, because we start sampling at the origin of the first curve segment.
Furthermore, if projections are off target with a greater distance than the variance of the noise model it leads to a distortion in the fitting result.
The ideal case would of course be to find a parametric 3D representation of the line features that could be plugged directly in to the registration process. The method to achieve this is to constrain the curve points in depth along the visual line from the focal point. The constructed registration pipeline is in its current state a good basis to further build upon and refine the
registration algorithm. The results are promising seeing that the deformed templates reflect the characteristics of the respective targets. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly concerning the expressiveness and the parts of the face between the that are not defined by line features, for example the chin and cheeks, of the obtained results. The results lack in accuracy, because of the necessitated use of a robust estimator as the loss function which is
due to certain areas of the face and head missing in either the template or the target. These missing regions cause artifacts despite the fact that a robust estimator is used. A possible improvement of the registration scheme therefore would be to first detect the vertices in the template mesh corresponding with the holes in the target mesh by registering the template with it. With the outlier regions detected, the Mean Squared Error could be used to achieve very accurate registration results without the appearance of artifacts. The proposed approaches will be subject of future work on this topic.\\

In conclusion, the presented approach to 3D face registration successfully incorporated line features to establish correspondence which lead to more expressive and accurate registration results.
