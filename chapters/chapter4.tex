\chapter{Registration Pipeline using Line Features}

\section{Definition of Line Features}
draw b√©zier curves
\section{Why use Line Features for Registration}

\section{Sampling 3D Points from 2D Line Features}
\subsection{Arc Length Parametrization}
\paragraph{In theory}

\paragraph{In practice}

\subsection{Projection on to the Mesh}
\paragraph{How registration worked so far?}

\paragraph{Proposed "Solution"}

\section{Preparing the Mean Mesh}
rendering, marking line features, projecting back possible, because we know direction

\section{Rigid Mesh Alignment}
simple rigid transformation of the scanned face onto the mean, transformation computed from landmark vectors.
