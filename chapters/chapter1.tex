\chapter{Introduction}
Registration is the method of making data from different measurements or even sources comparable by applying a transformation. It has many applications, for example in computer vision and medically imaging.
Registration is also the first step in building a 3D model of morphable faces using facial scans. It is used to establish a dense correspondence between the input scans with a transformation. This transformation is normally computed with the help of a set of corresponding points and assures that the vertices defining the surface of the scans are semantically structured in a way that they describe the same parts of the face. \begin{comment}Correspondence betweenk two faces is established by deforming a template face on to a target face.\end{comment} Defining a reproducable and accurate registration algorithm is therefore essential to obtaining a ``good'' 3D model. 
In this thesis we present a registration algorithm which is novel to the problem of 3D  face registration in two ways: the transformation is modeled using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a method from the field of Machine Learning and the prior information used in the transformation is extended to parametric curves marking key regions of the face, refered to as line features. It covers Model Building bascis, the theory behind GPR Theory, the implementation of a
face registration pipeline using GPR and line features. The registration results give a first expression of what registration results can be achieved with this approach
